# yanderesimulator-macos
Wrapper for Yandere Simulator for MacOS 10.13+
Uh this is pretty lazily done but this wrapper should work on Apple Silicon Macs, I'm too lazy but I should probably also make an Intel one... probably.
All versions of Yandere Simulator should work, the latest one seems to be working very well on a M1 Macbook Air, so it should run well on any Silicon Mac really.


## Download and install
You'll need to download the actual Yandere Simulator game and the latest build of this wrapper, which you can download in the releases section
