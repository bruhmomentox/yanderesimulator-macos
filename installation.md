# Installation
## Your First launch!!!
Download `YandereSimulator.dmg`and move the app anywhere you want, preferably to your Applications folder. Now open it. A window should pop up, asking for a game archive. Download the latest version of Yandere Simulator and choose the executable file inside that window.
